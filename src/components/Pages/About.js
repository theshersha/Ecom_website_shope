          Shopping has become a happy experience that we will seldom want to forego.
          Be it the pop-culture portrayal or the never-ending sales, no one leaves a
          store with just a loaf of bread. Money may not be able to buy happiness, but
          it can surely get you started on fashion.

          Shopping has almost become an art,and not everyone has the talent to buy the right things.
          As your shopping buddies grow,it is always better to have some quotes about shopping handy.
          The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one.
          Let us live for the beauty of our own reality.
